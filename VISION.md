# Elpis Vision

Elpis is the continuity layer around an AI coding runtime.

The user should be able to change a provider, model, or local runtime without losing the working agreement that makes an agent useful: the current goal, admitted context, permissions, decisions, and evidence. Elpis owns that durable boundary; the provider owns inference.

## Product promise

**Change the runtime. Keep the thread.**

Elpis should make four things visible and inspectable:

1. **Goal** — what the current session is trying to accomplish.
2. **Context** — which project instructions and memories were deliberately admitted.
3. **Control** — which tools and permissions the runtime may use.
4. **Evidence** — what changed, what was verified, and what remains unknown.

## Design direction

Elpis should feel like a serious instrument rather than another chat wrapper. Its visual language is deep charcoal with ember and rose for activity, while verdigris is reserved for confirmed or admitted state. Dense operational detail should remain legible, calm, and subordinate to the current goal.

The public website may borrow RAG Studio's standard of polish, but not its composition or palette. It should explain Elpis to someone who has never used an agent harness, show the continuity model directly, and keep experimental work clearly separated from available behavior.

## Truth boundaries

- Manual project memory is user-maintained and admitted through the Context Ledger. Do not imply automatic memory extraction or promotion.
- Automatic context pruning and deterministic work graphs are experimental and off by default. Do not present them as everyday guarantees.
- Historical evaluations may be reported with their original scope and caveats. They do not establish general task-quality improvement.
- Elpis is a Linux-first early-access project. Do not describe the current candidate as production-ready until daily-driver acceptance is complete.
- Local, inspectable state is a product property; provider requests still follow the provider or runtime the user selects.

## Near-term outcome

Ship an evidence-backed public website, validate it at desktop and mobile sizes, and make the early-access install path and source repository easy to inspect.
